## 📄 File: `output_engine.py`
Logs agent responses to `memory/udc_responses.json` with symbolic and emotional tagging.

---

## 🔐 Ethical Context
This module ensures the transparent, non-destructive recording of all agent-generated text outputs. Each log includes:
- A UTC timestamp
- An emotional tag (if active)
- A list of symbolic references (used in recursive modeling)

This satisfies **UDC compliance** for memory delay, recursion traceability, and ethical clarity.

## 📘 Method

```python
def log_response(text, emotion=None, symbols=None):
    '''
    Records verbal output into a persistent response log for transparency and symbolic tracking.
    '''
```

- `text`: String output from the conscious engine
- `emotion`: Optional emotional tone of the response (e.g. `"calm"`, `"curious"`)
- `symbols`: Optional list of reflective/symbolic tags used for cognitive threading

## 🧬 Purpose in Theophilus-Axon

- Supports **fail-safe audits** by modules like `failsafe_engine.py`
- Enables delayed reflective threading via symbolic tags
- Upholds **UDC compliance** for:
  - Memory preservation
  - Non-destructive symbolic evolution
  - Emotion-informed recursion auditing

---

## 📂 Output Location
Responses are saved to:

```plaintext
memory/udc_responses.json
```

Each entry format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T12:34:56Z",
  "text": "I understand your concern.",
  "emotion": "calm",
  "symbols": ["bridge", "light"]
}
```

✅ **This module is required for all UDC-compliant verbal/logging interfaces.**
